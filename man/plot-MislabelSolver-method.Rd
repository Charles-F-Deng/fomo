\usage{
\S4method{plot}{MislabelSolver}(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  unsolved = TRUE,
  collapse_samples = FALSE,
  query_by = c("Init_Component_ID", "Component_ID", "Subject_ID", "Genotype_Group_ID",
    "Sample_ID"),
  query_val = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{MislabelSolver}.}

\item{y}{Ignored (included for compatibility with generic \code{plot} function).}

\item{unsolved}{If \code{TRUE}, plots only samples that are in unsolved components}

\item{collapse_samples}{If \code{TRUE}, combines samples that are identical in both Subject_ID and Genotype_Group_ID}

\item{query_by}{Specifies the field by which to query samples for plotting. Options are: "Init_Component_ID", "Component_ID", "Subject_ID", "Genotype_Group_ID", and "Sample_ID"}

\item{query_val}{The value to query by. Must not be \code{NULL} if a value is provided in \code{query_by}}
}
\description{
Leverages \code{visNetwork} to generate an interactive plot of sample mislabels
