\title{Comprehensive-based Sample Relabeling}
\usage{
solveComprehensiveSearch(object, max_genotypes = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A MislabelSolver object}

\item{max_genotypes}{(Default = 8) The number of combinations scales in factorial
with the number of genotypes in the largest connected component.
The algorithm will skip over all components that exceed this size.}
}
\value{
A MislabelSolver object
}
\description{
This comprehensive function permutes over all combinations of assigning a
Subject_ID to a Genotype_Group_ID, then picks the assignment that implies the
fewest number of sample mislabels and deletions.
}
