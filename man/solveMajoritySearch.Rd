\description{
This heuristic function assigns a Subject_ID to a Genotype_Group_ID if a
majority of samples within that Genotype_Group_ID have the same Subject_ID label.
In other words, if most samples in a particular group share the same Subject_ID,
then that Subject_ID is assigned to the entire group.
